# 64-bit guest demo

This application creates a virtual machine where the guest switches into 64-bit long mode and performs a series of 64-bit operations.

The initialization procedure follows the instructions on [Entering Long Mode Directly in the OSDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Entering_Long_Mode_Directly).
