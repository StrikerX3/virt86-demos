# Basic demo

This applications demonstrates basic usage of a number of features provided by virt86.

It selects the first platform available in the system and creates a virtual machine with one processor, 64 KiB of ROM at 0xFFFF0000 and 1 MiB of RAM at 0x00000000. No other hardware is emulated.

The ROM program initializes the virtual CPU to 32-bit protected mode with paging enabled and executes a series of instructions designed to test several features of the virtualization platform:
- Basic virtual memory support, to ensure the paging setup is correct
- Basic stack tests, for the same purpose
- Software interrupts generated by `INT` instructions in the guest
- Hardware interrupts injected via the hypervisor
- I/O and MMIO
- Guest debugging, including:
    - Single stepping
    - Software breakpoints
    - Hardware breakpoints
- Extended VM exits
    - CPUID access

Other virt86 features tested include:
- Platform features listing
- Dirty page tracking
- Linear address translations
